# Post Mortem

My idea for this game was to make something simple that I could actually finish in a month. Last year I had a more ambitous multiplayer idea that was never finalized. To speed up development I based the program on code from Foundation Game Design with HTML5 and JavaScript by Rex van der Spuy from 2012. Even if this book is over ten years old the code is still working, probably since it is very basic. Anyway, thanks to this code I could spend a lot of time on improving my game, adding for example parallax scrolling layers.

The game design is just a 2d platformer with some added features such as a jet pack and a ray gun. The goal is to collect all the time stones before reaching the exit. Nothing original, in other words. The game unfortunately was percieved as difficult in many comments. One contributing factor is probably the frame rate which is set to work on 60 FPS. Playing it on 144 FPS was obviously not a nice experiance, but this was relatively easy to fix with a time stamp. This and other updates can be found in the Gothic Tower Redux folder. See also:

Finally, thanks for organizing the js13k Game Jam 2023, and to everyone commenting on my game!
